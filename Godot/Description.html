<h3><em>Opalescence: A chromatic effect, commonly found in opal, in which colors
  reflected off an object depend on viewing angle<br></em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;<em><strong>Opalescence </strong></em>is a colorful bullet-hell in which you
  collect points, fight enemies, and dodge to get a high score. <br></p>
<h3>Four Main Game Modes</h3>
<p>Though it can change in some missions, the goal of the game is usually quite simple; <em>Collect Points, And Survive</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Points are the colorful small pellets that
appear around the map. Getting a point changes your color and keeps your light
from fading.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Tutorial</h4></li>
  <p>In this game mode, you will learn the basics of the game though a series of a
    few short missions.</p>
  <li><h4>Standard</h4></li>
  <p>In <em>Standard</em>, you try to consistently beat your best score with in the
    using the game's standard rule set. The challenge gets harder as you go.
    But with your laser, your cannon, and power-ups, you can probably survive...
    for a while. Get the highest score you can!</p>
  <li><h4>Missions</h4></li>
  <p>Much like the tutorial mode, in <em>Missions</em>, you have specific tasks to
     complete. This time, they will require much more quick-thinking, dexterity,
     and reaction time. Finish each mission with as many points as possible or in
      the shortest amount of time to get that high score!</p>
  <li><h4>Challenge</h4></li>
  <p>
    You pick and choose modifications to the standard rule-set to make the game
     harder (or easier). By making the game harder, you can increase how many
     points you can earn. How many lives you start with, how quickly your light
    fades, and how fast you move are all up to you in this mode!
  </p>
</ul>
<h3>Entity Types</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Player</h4></li>
    <p>
      The colorful <em>colorful</em> crescent-shaped entity that you control. To defend yourself,
      you can shoot your canon (left-mouse-button or left-bumper on controller), shoot
      a laser (right-mouse-button, or right-bumper on controller), drop bombs, or you can simply
      dodge.
    </p>
  <li><h4>Chaser</h4></li>
    <p>
      The <em><strong>Chaser</strong></em> is the most common enemy type. They are
      the black triangles which follow you. If they touch you, you will explode.
      They come in different sizes, the smaller they are, the faster, but they will
      also have less health. <strong><em>Chasers</em></strong> have a pretty low
      amount of health, but if several corner you, things can get dicey. If you
      make a <strong><em>Chasers</em></strong> collide with another enemy type, they
      will damage and potentially kill it. Given their low health, making to
      <strong>Chasers</strong> collide almost always kills both of them
      <br>
    </p>
  <li><h4>Shooter</h4></li>
    <p>The <strong><em>Shooter</em><em> </em></strong>is the second most common
       enemy. They are diamond-shaped stationary enemies. Instead of moving,
       they launch missiles at you. The missiles just move in a straight line
       so they are pretty easy to dodge on their own. Just like chasers, missiles
       will damage other enemies they collide with.
       <br>
     </p>
  <li><h4>Eater</h4></li>
    <p>
    The <strong>Eater</strong> looks like an eight-sided star largest of all
    enemy-types. <strong>Eaters</strong> are resilient enemies, having the
    highest health. On top of that, they are immune to the canon. Only lasers
    and bombs will kill them. <strong>Eaters</strong> aren't stationary like the
    <strong>Shooters</strong>, but also don't came after you like the
    <strong>Chasers</strong>, instead, they always move toward the closest point
    until they touch and destroy it. They repeat this until they are destroyed
    </p>

<h3>Power-ups</h3>
<p>In all but a few missions and tutorials, large (mostly) colorful capsules will
appear. These are called <strong>Power-Ups</strong>. They come in quite a few different flavors,
and can be distinguished by their color. You collect them as you do points,
(simply running into them). When you do collect a <strong>Power-up</strong> you
will be granted a certain ability or have one of your stats changed in a positive
way. Each power-up changes you in a unique way, and their effects are as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Power-Up Name</th>
    <th>Effect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>Barrage</td>
  	<td>Makes you shoot your canon much faster, unleashing a barrage of pellets on your enemies</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>Bombastic</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>Bullet Time</td>
  	<td>Slows down time itself, but slows the player down less than everything else</td>
  </tr>

<h3>Coming soon</h3>
<p>
    Some of the features I intend on adding relatively soon. Any suggested features
    would be appreciated and considered.
  </p>
<ul>
    <li><h5>Some Type Of Store</h5></li>
      <p>
        I want to add a store in which you can buy different player buffs. Potential
        purchasable buffs would include increasing the number of bullets per
        canon-volley, increasing the time duration or a specific power-up, or
        decreasing cool-down time of the laser. <br>
        The currency spent at the store will be the points you collect while playing
        the standard game mode or the missions. These will be saved every time you
        play and accumulate over time. Challenge mode will also probably give you
        this currency, but without score multiplier won't.
      </p>
    <li><h5>A System for Steadily Increasing Difficulty During a Session</h5></li>
      <p>
        In challenge and standard mode, this would make the game get harder as
        the player doesn't die. I think having different levels that have progressively
        harder settings, but a higher score multiplier would be interesting. Making it
        so that every two minutes you survive you go up a level would be a neat way
        of separating them. Perhaps adding a sort of boss or mini event between
        levels could be fun
      </p>
    <li><h5>More Enemy Types</h5></li>
      <p>
        I have an idea or two for more enemy types, but I'm not entirely sold on
        any of them quite yet. two examples are, an enemy sort of like a shooter
        but shoots small chasers instead of missiles, and an enemy that follows,
        you, but doesn't try to collide with you. Instead, it just gets somewhat
        close, before charging a laser and shooting at you. Ive been thinking
        that instead of doing damage or killing you the laser could be a sort of
        tractor beam that could lock onto you, and would either slow
        you down, prevent you from shooting, or slowly drain your points. There's
        a lot of potentially fun and interesting enemy types that are possible.
      </p>
  </ul>
