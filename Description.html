<h1>Opalescence</h1>
<p><br></p>
<h4>What is it?</h4>
<p><em>Opalescence refers to the specific color-shifting effect commonly found in opal</em></p>
<p>In <strong>Opalescence</strong>, you will cast your color-filled light into the darkness and destroy your enemies.</p>
<h3>Four Main Modes</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>Tutorial</h4></li>
<p>In this game mode, you will learn the basics of the game though a series of a few short missions.</p>
<li><h4>Standard</h4></li>
<p>In <em>Standard</em>, you try to consistently beat your best score with in the using the game's standard rule set. The challenge gets harder as you go. But with your laser, your cannon, and power-ups, you can probably survive... for a while. Get the highest score you can!</p>
<li><h4>Missions</h4></li>
<p>Much like the tutorial mode, in <em>Missions</em>, you have specific tasks to complete. This time, they will require much more quick-thinking, dexterity, and reaction time. Finish each mission with as many points as possible or in the shortest amount of time to get that high score!</p>
<li><h4>Challenge</h4></li>
<p>You pick and choose modifications to the standard rule-set to make the game harder (or easier). By making the game harder, you can increase how many points you can earn. How many lives you start with, how quickly your light fades, and how fast you move are all up to you in this mode!</p>
</ul>
